					<h1>About Me</h1>

					<p><img src="images/csaeed.jpg" width="200" class="main-pic" alt="Craig Saeed">My name is Craig
						Saeed, I am originally from Chicago, IL. My goal or reason for taking this
						course is to
						relaunch my career as a developer. Having worked as a front end developer for many years and not
						continuing to train and upgrade my skills, I killed my career as a web developer. I was laid off
						earlier
						this year and quickly realized I needed training if I ever planned to work as a web developer
						ever
						again. </p>

					<p>Hopefully, by doing these things I am able to return to work and better support my family. Losing
						my job was a mental knockout and these last seven months have really brought me to a true
						humbling
						place in my life. I have learned that in order to be successful you must <em>"Bullet-Proof"</em>
						your
						career. The little things count, the networking, coder sites &amp; blogs, the conventions etc,
						all matter. If I could speak to any aspiring developer my biggest advise would to "stay hungry,
						learn as much as you can for as long as you can".</p>
